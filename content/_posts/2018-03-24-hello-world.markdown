We're very excited, because the webpage for [ElChemRoutes2018](http://www.elchemroutes2018.events) is online.

This UK-India workshop will discuss emerging technologies in electrochemical energy storage and conversion for a developing world. The focal point is on next-generation materials for fuel cells and batteries, but we will also discuss new trends incl. electrochemical routes to upgrading CO2 and ammonia synthesis. The topic is particularly relevant for India, where electricity supply is often intermittent and unreliable; over 300 million people have no access to electricity at all.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we will bring together 30+ early-career academics from the UK and India
* **Date**: 9-15 of December, expect lectures and plenty of time to mingle
* **Venue**: Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research - this beautiful campus is located in the north of Bangalore
* **Speakers**: we will cover **all** your costs - that's right, flights, accomodation, food: all free.

and we've already secured leading academics from the UK and India to share their expertise:

* **Anthony Kucernak** - Imperial College London<br>
* **Paul Shearing** - University College London<br>
* **Vijayamohanan Pillai** - CSIR-CECRI<br>
* **Swapan Pati** - JNCASR<br>


More details will appear in subsequent posts, in the meantime you can subscribe to our [email list](http://www.elchemroutes2018.events) to stay tuned.
