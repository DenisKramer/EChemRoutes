We have told the world. Calls for applications have been issued as widely as possible. So we are sure you are aware:

*We welcome applications from Early-Career Academics (less than 10 years post PhD or equivalent) until 30 June 2018*

Please head over to our webpage to [apply](http://www.elchemroutes2018.events/apply). It's as simple as answering a few questions.

We have issued calls directly to over 100 academic groups in the UK and India. In addition, a number of networks including [stfcbatteries.org](http://stfcbatteries.org), the [Energy Storage Research Network](http://energysuperstore.org/esrn/), and the [H2FC SuperGen](http://www.h2fcsupergen.com) have kindly agreed to forward our call to their members to reach as many as we can.
