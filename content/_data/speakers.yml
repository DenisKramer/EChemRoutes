  name: "Paul"
  surname: "Shearing"
  company: "University College London"
  title: "Reader in Chemical Engineering & Materials"
  bio: "Prof Paul Shearing (PRS) UCL is Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in
  Emerging Technologies at University College London and from 2012-16 was a
  holder of a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship. His research
  interests cover a broad range of electrochemical engineering themes with a
  particular interest in the relationship between performance and microstructure
  for energy materials: an area in which he has published more than 130 papers
  in the past 5 years (>3000 citations, h=31). He is a pioneer of '4-D Tomography'
  to study microstructure in electrochemical materials, and has used most of
  the world's major synchrotron light sources. He is a founding investigator of
  the newly formed Faraday Institution, and leads the STFC Global Challenge
  Network in Batteries and Electrochemical Energy Devices.  In 2014 he was
  named 'Young Chemical Engineer of the Year in Academia' by the Institute of
  Chemical Engineers and in 2016 the RAEng Engineers Trust Young Engineer of the Year."

  name: S.
  surname: Sampath
  company: Indian Institute of Science
  title: Professor
  bio: "S. Sampath Completed his B. Sc. in Chemistry from Madurai Kamaraj University, in 1981.
  He did his M. Sc. in Chemistry in the year 1983 from Madras University. He pursued his PhD
  on Electrochemistry, 1991 from IIT Madras. Thereafter he worked as Postdoctoral Associate
  in Osaka University, Japan (1992-1994) and Hebrew University, Israel (1994-1997). Now he
  has been working as professor in the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry,
  Indian Institute of Science. The main focus of his research is to understand interfacial
  properties involving novel materials and modified surfaces. They use a combination of spectroscopy,
  electrochemistry and microscopy to understand the interfacial properties. Coupled in-situ
  techniques based on electrochemical FTIR, Raman electrochemistry are routinely used to
  understand various aspects."
