  title: "Research Associate"
  bio: "I am currently working as a postdoctoral research associate in the fields of advanced materials for energy storage and environmental protection at the University of Bath. My recent work has focused on energy gas adsorption and CO2 capture of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) and their composites. My long-term goal is to facilitate cutting-edge technologies to tackle the challenges for low carbon society and sustainable energy systems. I received my PhD degree from the University of East Anglia, UK. My PhD project focused on energy storage of the novel synthesis of carbon materials with the controlled structures using a self-designed plasma reactor through natural gas splitting. I successfully applied Design of Experiment (DoE) for methane decomposition procedure to improve the reactor design and control the quantity of the productions. The obtained series of porous carbon with novel structures have been used for the enhanced hydrogen storage, CO2 capture, air protection and wastewater treatment. I have developed excellent analytical skills and abilities to solve problems and deliver high-quality scientific presentations, as well as experience in a range of characterisation techniques. The significant achievements include successful technology transfer to industry that led to a patent, a new catalyst for enhancing hydrogen storage property of Mg-based materials and development of in-situ gas separation breakthrough apparatus."

  title: "Lecturer in Energy Materials"
  bio: "I graduated from the University of Barcelona in 2009. After this, I was granted a WestChem studentship to course my Ph.D. studies with Prof. Gregory at the University of Glasgow. During my PhD, with thesis title Novel synthesis and characterisation of Li-N-(H)-based materials for energy storage and conversion, I developed ultra-fast and energy-efficient synthetic routes using microwave chemistry and tribology to produce bulk and nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion. This was followed by a short-term EU-funded postdoc on the same topic. During these years, I gained extensive experience in a wide range of techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction and Rietveld analysis; scanning and transmission electron microscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy. In 2013, I moved the University of St. Andrews to work as a Postdoctoral Fellow with Prof. Peter Bruce in energy-storage materials for Li-ion and Na-ion battery applications. My main research efforts were directed towards developing and understanding the structure-property-electrochemical performance relationship in novel transition metal oxide cathode materials for lithium and sodium-ion batteries. In 2014, I moved with Prof. Bruce and his research group to the University of Oxford to work as a Research Fellow and Team Leader of the Sodium-ion battery team. In December 2016, I became a Lecturer in Chemistry at Lancaster University. In the first year of my appointment I have secured funding from several funding bodies, i.e. Innovate UK, Royal Society and STFC to develop projects in energy storage. I am also a member of the Alistore European battery network and the STFC battery network. My research work has been published in peer-reviewed high-impact factor journals such as EES, Chem. Mater, Nature Chem and JACS and I have also presented my work in broad and specialised international and national conferences."

  title: "Lecturer"
  bio: " I am an electrochemist with expertise in catalysis of fuel cells and the application of in situ and operand 3D x-ray tomography of fuel cells, lithium ion batteries and redox flow batteries. In particular, I have developed x-ray imaging techniques for flow battery electrodes, both commercially available carbon felts and novel electrospun carbonised fibrous media, and their application in modelling of flow and permeability properties. In July 2018 I will start my first academic position as a lecturer in Chemical Engineering at UCL. I am also the scientific administrator of the STFC Batteries Network as well as the project lead for the Faraday Institution fast start project in Degradation. I look forward to the opportunity to make some new international collaborations and explore novel avenues of science in this early stage of my career, and I believe this workshop would be the perfect opportunity to do this."

  surname: Walton
  company: "University of Manchester"
  title: "Research Fellow"
  bio: "I have based my career around the development and application of spectroscopic and microscopical techniques to gain fundamental understanding of the structure/function relationships of nanomaterials, with a particular emphasis on materials for energy conversion and storage. I have published 30 papers, including Nature Communications, ACS Nano (x3), Nano Letters and Advanced Functional Materials. In total these have received over 650 citations. My H-index is 16. I received my PhD in Physics in 2010 from the University of Leeds, where I grew and characterised semiconductor nanowires with an emphasis on energy applications. Subsequently, I worked as a postdoc in the world-leading surface science group at Aarhus University, Denmark. There, I demonstrated how to combine atom-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy with X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy to gain a complete picture of structure and reactivity on model electrocatalyst surfaces. We were able to understand the fundamental interaction of water with these materials on the atomic scale, leading to a series of publications including ACS Nano 9 2445-53 and Nat. Commun. 8 14169. Since my appointment in Manchester as a Research Fellow in 2015, I have led the research activity on UoMâ€™s Near-Ambient Pressure X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) instrument. This has included the successful application of NAP-XPS to follow surface chemistry in-situ - allowing the study of functional materials under realistic operating conditions. In collaboration with UK research groups I have applied this technique to diverse systems such as solar cell materials, ionic liquids and in-operando studies of heterogeneous catalysis. My current focus is the development of the NAP-XPS technique to allow operando characterisation of battery electrodes. I have recently published proof-of-concept (JPCM 2017, 29, 454001) showing that the solid/liquid interface can be measured in-situ in XPS and plan to develop this further to allow the study of this interface under electrochemical polarization."
