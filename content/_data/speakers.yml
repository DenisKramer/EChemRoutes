His PhD work based on multidisciplinary research areas focusing on modification of electrode surfaces with 2D and 3D nanostructures, electrochemical deposition of nano-materials, nanoporous structures, Pb-doped 3D nanostructures, electrodeposited MOFs, polymerized ionic liquids, polymer/ionic liquid composites, and microcontact printing of highly hydrophobic organic molecules to print micropatterns and employed all these modified devices to develop RTIL-based gas sensors. He also develop some models for fast-reversible, quasi-reversible and irreversible redox process using Dig-Elch Simulator, to investigate which electrochemical techniques is more sensitive for a particular analyte in aqueous, organic and RTILs based media. He started his postdoc position in June 2018, as a Rutherford Research Fellow with Professor Angel Cuesta, which is strategic partnership between Curtin University of WA and University of Aberdeen UK. In Aberdeen, he is focussing on in-situ electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques based on surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy couple with total reflectance mode (ATR-SEIRAS). He is investigating the interfacial properties of different adlayers in the presence of different cations to understand the electroadsorption/reduction of different gases such as CO2, CO on Pt-coated electrodes in aqueous media and the effect of different cations hydrophilicity and their size on the structure of electrical double layer."
